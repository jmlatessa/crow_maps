1160AllTestResults.txt:
   what is the difference between PROC_NAME, PROC_CODE, TEST_NAME and which of these is going to be best to use?


	Contains our ORD_VALUE

	drop NAN values, remove ORDER_STATUS--assume we only want completed results.
	drop ORDER_RAW_VALUE
	drop REFERENCE_UNIT



1160AllBasicTestResults.txt:
	Appears to have same columns as Alltestresults, but has fewer unique values across the board. Only completed orders?

	Thinking of using this one and ignoring alltesresults.


	Contains our ORD_VALUE

	KEPT:

	['PAT_ID', 'CURRENT_AGE', 'BIRTH_DATE', 

        'GENDER', 'RACE', 'ETHNIC_GROUP',

       'CONTACT_DATE', 'ORDERING_DATE',

       'PROC_NAME', 'TEST_NAME', 'ORD_VALUE']

1160Mapping.csv:
	Used for linking across other files, master list for date references.
	How we could think of the day features in test results--
 	Days after first date in mappings file within a few months.
 	Days since first visit?
 

1160FlowsheetResult.txt:
	Why are there only half the patient ID's in there? only inpatient?

	What of this information would be worth preserving here?

	How much of this information is redudant/repeated with encountervital.txt
    

1160EncounterVital.txt:
	What is the weight in?

	We can figure out the date of this by using the PAT_ENC_CSN_ID to link with mapping date. 
	Can take use the vitals nearest to the urine culture order for data row creation

	[BP_SYSTOLIC,	BP_DIASTOLIC,	TEMPERATURE	PULSE,	WEIGHT,	HEIGHT,	RESPIRATIONS,	BMI]


1160Diagnosis.txt:
	No idea what this one means, maybe include IS_UC_ORDER_DIAG?

1160Medication.txt:
	Definitely want to include this, csn ids are totally off with dates in mapping file. completely off.
	What of this information is relevant? and should be preserved? Again with most recent 

1160PatientList.txt:
	[CURRENT_AGE	BIRTH_DATE	DEATH_DATE	GENDER	RACE	ETHNIC_GROUP]

Thinking:

We're interested in why these tests are ordered. In that case, are we can probably split just by ordered lab, rather than patients or encounters.

We almost have information overload at this point. It's difficult to parse through it all.

Do we do maximum or most recent vitals?


Target classes for 0, 1 (ORD_VALUE): 
0: Normal urogenital flora and also No Growth/No growth after 48 hours. no growth after 2 days.
1: Everything else


Deal with data:

5 year dataset--narrow in terms of timeline.

Gender identity excel sheet. 130 trans patients to evaluate.

alltestresults vs basictestresults---need to figure out differences.

can use each urine culture as a data row.

eventually want to model inpatient, outpatient, emergency department. 

flowsheets only for inpatients? maybe yes, we can just use encounter vitals.


for encountervitals, include encountervitals that immediately precede culture order. Might want to look at peak values in previous 2 days. 

diagnoses--ignore for now? probably icd10 codes and their uses. Think about it.

medication antibiotic administration date before culture order? 

were they treated with antibiotics after urine culture?
were they on antibiotics before urine culture?

Medications ---probably want to add thera_class.
